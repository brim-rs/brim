Building the compiler is pretty straightforward. The compiler is written in Rust.
We don't believe the compiler will be mature enough in the near future to be able to bootstrap itself. So for now you will need Rust installed on your system. 
Follow the instructions here: [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - to install documentation dependencies

We use `just` as a task runner for the project. Some more advanced tasks like running compiler tests are defined in the internal build tool called [`snap`](/docs/dev-guide/snap).

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brim-rs/brim
```

## Build the compiler

```bash
just setup
```

What does this do?

1. Builds the compiler for debug mode
2. Install the documentation dependencies
