In Brim, identifiers are used to name variables, functions, modules, and other language elements. Identifiers must adhere to specific rules to ensure clarity and consistency in your codebase.

## **Rules for Identifiers**

1. **Characters**:
- Identifiers may consist of letters, digits, and underscores (`_`).
- They must begin with a letter or an underscore, not a digit.

```brim
valid_name    // Valid
_privateVar   // Valid although will warn because of the non-snake case
123name       // Invalid (cannot start with a digit)
```

2. **Case Sensitivity**:

Identifiers are case-sensitive. This means `myVar` and `MyVar` are considered different identifiers.

```brim
myVar = 10
MyVar = 20

print(myVar)  // 10
print(MyVar)  // 20
```

3. **Reserved Keywords**:

Identifiers cannot be a keyword or a reserved word in Brim. For example, you cannot name a variable `fn` or `let`.

```brim
let fn = 10  // Invalid
let let = 20 // Invalid
```

## **Naming Conventions**

While Brim does not enforce strict naming conventions, the program will warn you about these rules.
Following these practices can make your code more readable and maintainable:

1. **Variables and Functions**:
- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
```brim
fn calculate_area(width: i32, height: i32) {
    let max_value = 100;
    return width * height;
};
```

2. **Constants**:
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
```brim
const PI = 3.14159;
```

4. **Types and Traits**:
- Use `PascalCase` for structs and traits.
```brim
struct Rectangle {
    width: Int
    height: Int
};

trait Drawable {
    fn draw();
};
```
